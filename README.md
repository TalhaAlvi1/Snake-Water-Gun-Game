# Snake-Water-Gun Game

This is a simple command-line game implemented in Python where the user plays against the computer. The game follows the traditional Snake-Water-Gun rules:

## Rules
- **Snake beats Water**
- **Water beats Gun**
- **Gun beats Snake**
- If both the player and computer choose the same option, it's a tie.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your choice: `snake`, `water`, or `gun`.
3. The computer will randomly select one of the three choices.
4. The result (win, lose, or tie) will be displayed.
